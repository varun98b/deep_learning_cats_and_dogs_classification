# deep_learning_cats_and_dogs_classification

The code attached is a complete implementation of a VGG-like convolutional neural network (CNN) with Batch Normalization and Dropout for binary classification on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. Data preprocessing: The code defines data generators for the training and validation sets. It includes data augmentation for the training set to improve model generalization.

2. Model architecture: The VGG-like model includes convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model's architecture is defined in the `create_vgg_model` function.

3. Compilation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification.

4. Training: The model is trained using the training and validation generators. Training progress is monitored, and training/validation loss and accuracy are plotted over epochs.

5. Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test set using the `evaluate` method, and the test accuracy is displayed.
